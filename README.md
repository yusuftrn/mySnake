# Welcome to mySnake!

It's clone of **Snake game**. Snake first appeared in 1997 on the Nokia 6110, along with the games Logic and Memory. It was programmed by Taneli Armanto, a design engineer in Nokia. The concept originated from the 1976 arcade game â€˜Blockadeâ€™, developed and published by Gremlin
